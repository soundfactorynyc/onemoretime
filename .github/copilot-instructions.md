# Sound Factory Grid Project

This is an Astro project for creating an interactive 192-component sound factory grid interface.

## Project Structure
- **One component per page approach** - Each major component should be built as a separate, focused page
- **Modern dark theme** with gradients and animations
- **Interactive grid interface** with 3 main sections (Mix, React, Chat)
- **Component-based architecture** for reusability

## Key Features to Implement
1. **Sound Factory Grid** - 192 interactive buttons organized in 64-button grids
2. **Component Interfaces** - Individual control panels for each sound component
3. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
4. **Modern Styling** - Dark theme with neon accents and smooth animations

## Coding Guidelines
- Use clean, semantic HTML
- Implement CSS custom properties for theming
- Create modular, reusable components
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels
- Optimize for performance and smooth animations

## File Organization
- `/src/pages/` - Main page components
- `/src/components/` - Reusable component library
- `/src/styles/` - Global styles and CSS modules
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and data
